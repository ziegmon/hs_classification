GRI 6 is used to compare subheadings at the same level.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: The historical data for a similar product (Kids, Shoes, Low cut, Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber, Construction: Missiongrip Rubber) classified under 6404119003 strongly influences this option, indicating that ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction is typically considered ""sports footwear.""
3.  *Chapter Determination*: Chapter 64 is chosen as it specifically covers ""FOOTWEAR, GAITERS AND THE LIKE; PARTS OF SUCH ARTICLES.""
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 6404 is selected because the product has outer soles of rubber and uppers of textile materials, which perfectly matches the description: ""FOOTWEAR WITH OUTER SOLES OF RUBBER, PLASTICS, LEATHER OR COMPOSITION LEATHER AND UPPERS OF TEXTILE MATERIALS.""
5.  *Subheading Determination*:
    *   Subheading 6404.1 is chosen for ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics,"" which aligns with the product's rubber sole.
    *   Subheading 6404.11 is selected for ""Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like."" The ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction is characteristic of athletic or outdoor sports footwear, making this a strong fit for ""training shoes and the like.""

1,JAPAN,Shoes Mid Cut,Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber,Missiongrip Rubber,Kids,Product for JAPAN: Kids's Shoes Mid Cut Material: Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber. Construction: Missiongrip Rubber.,6404.11.000,80,640411000,6404.11.000,100,Validated (with Reasoning),"1.  *GRI Application*: GRI 1 is applied, as the product's description directly matches the terms of Heading 64.04 and Subheading 6404.11. GRI 6 is used to determine the national tariff line, ensuring the most specific classification within the hierarchy.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: Historical data for a very similar product (Kids' Shoes, Textile upper, Rubber sole, Missiongrip Rubber construction) was previously classified under 6404.11.000. This strong precedent, with identical key characteristics (materials, construction, and gender), heavily influences the classification of the current product as sports footwear. The ""Mid Cut"" aspect does not preclude it from this subheading.
3.  *Chapter Determination*: Chapter 64 is chosen as it specifically covers ""Footwear, gaiters and the like; parts of such articles,"" which directly applies to the product.
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 64.04 is selected because it explicitly covers ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials."" The product's outer sole of rubber and uppers of textile materials perfectly align with this heading.
5.  *Subheading Determination*: Subheading 6404.11 is chosen because the product's ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction, which implies specialized grip and durability, combined with its designation as ""Kids' Shoes"" (often implying active use), strongly suggests an intended use as ""Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like."" The ""Mid Cut"" design is consistent with various types of athletic footwear.
6.  *National Tariff Line*: The national tariff line ""000"" is the only available and most specific option provided under 6404.11, completing the 9-digit HS code for Japan.
7.  *Footwear-Specific Considerations*: The ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction is a critical indicator of athletic or performance-oriented footwear, directly supporting the ""Sports footwear"" classification. The ""Kids'"" aspect further reinforces the likelihood of active or sports-related use.",2025-10-12 12:05:47

GRI 6 applies the same principle to subheadings.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: No similar historical footwear data was found, so classification relies solely on the provided product description and official documentation.
3.  *Chapter Determination*: Chapter 64 is chosen as it specifically covers ""Footwear, gaiters and the like; parts of such articles."" The product is clearly footwear.
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 6404 is selected because it covers ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials."" The product explicitly states ""Sole: Rubber"" and ""Upper: Textile,"" perfectly matching this heading.
5.  *Subheading Determination*: Within Heading 6404, subheading 6404.1 covers ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics."" Further, subheading 6404.11 specifically covers ""Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like."" The ""Mid Cut"" design often provides ankle support, common in athletic footwear (e.g., basketball shoes, hiking shoes). The ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction implies a specialized sole designed for enhanced grip and performance, which is a characteristic feature of sports or outdoor activity footwear. These elements strongly indicate an athletic or sports-oriented design for children.
6.  *National Tariff Line*: Assuming 6404.11.00 is the most granular 8-digit tariff item for ""Sports footwear"" with rubber soles and textile uppers in the official Swiss documentation. For Switzerland, the code must be 11 digits, so ""-000"" is appended to form 6404.1100-000.
7.  *Footwear-Specific Considerations*: The combination of ""Mid Cut"" and ""Missiongrip Rubber"" points to athletic/sports footwear. The ""Kids's"" designation indicates children's footwear, which falls under the general sports footwear category if no more specific children's sub-subheading is provided in the official documentation.",2025-10-12 12:05:47

Construction: Rubber.,6404.11.9020,80,6404119020,6404.11.9020,100,Validated (with Reasoning),"1.  *GRI Application*: GRI 1 directs classification by the terms of the headings and section/chapter notes. GRI 6 applies these principles to subheadings.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: The historical data for a similar product (identical description except for the statistical suffix) points to 6404.11.90. This strongly supports the 8-digit classification. However, the historical statistical suffix `50` (""Forwomen: Other"") contradicts the product's gender (""Men's Shoes""). Therefore, the 8-digit code is adopted, but the statistical suffix is corrected based on the current product's gender.
3.  *Chapter Determination*: Chapter 64, ""FOOTWEAR, GAITERS AND THE LIKE; PARTS OF SUCH ARTICLES,"" is the appropriate chapter for footwear.
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 6404 is selected: ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials."" This perfectly matches the product's outer sole material (rubber) and upper material (textile).
5.  *Subheading Determination*: Subheading 6404.11 is chosen: ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like."" Additional U.S. Note 2 clarifies that ""tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like"" covers athletic footwear, whether or not principally used for such athletic games. Low-cut shoes with textile uppers and rubber soles are commonly considered athletic or sports-style footwear, fitting this description.
6.  *National Tariff Line*: Within 6404.11, the product does not have uppers of which over 50% is leather. Therefore, it falls under ""Other."" Since no value is provided, and the historical data used the `90` suffix, it is reasonable to assume ""Valued over $12/pair,"" leading to 6404.11.90. For ""Men's"" footwear under this 8-digit code, the statistical suffix is `20` (""Formen: Other""). Thus, the full HS code is 6404.11.9020.
7.  *Footwear-Specific Considerations*: The product's low-cut design, textile upper, and rubber sole are characteristic of athletic or casual sports footwear, aligning with the ""tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like"" category. The ""Construction: Rubber"" further supports the rubber sole and common manufacturing methods for such footwear.",2025-10-12 12:05:47

Chapter 64 is appropriate for footwear. GRI 6 is applied for subheading determination, comparing subheadings at the same level.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: The historical classification of a similar product (Gender: Men, Desc1: Shoes, Desc2: Low cut, Material: Upper: Plastic / Sole: Rubber, Construction: Missiongrip Rubber) to HS Code 6402999032 strongly supports this option. This historical precedent aligns perfectly with the current product's characteristics.
3.  *Chapter Determination*: Chapter 64 is selected as it specifically covers ""FOOTWEAR"".
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 6402 is chosen because the product has ""OUTER SOLES AND UPPERS OF RUBBER OR PLASTICS"". The product's outer sole is Rubber and its upper is Plastic, fitting this description precisely. Heading 6401 was considered but rejected due to the lack of explicit ""waterproof"" designation and, more critically, the absence of a 10-digit code in the provided documentation for Australia.
5.  *Subheading Determination*:
    *   **6402.9 - Other footwear:** The product is not described as ""sports footwear"" (6402.1) nor does it have ""upper straps or thongs assembled to the sole by means of plugs"" (6402.20.00). Therefore, it falls under ""Other footwear.""
    *   **6402.99 -- Other:** The product is described as ""Low cut,"" which means it does not cover the ankle. This excludes 6402.91 (""-- Covering the ankle"") and places it under 6402.99 (""-- Other,"" meaning not covering the ankle).
    *   **6402.99.90 --- Other:** Within 6402.99, the product is not ""of a kind used solely or principally in conjunction with diving dress or wetsuits"" (6402.99.10), leading to the general ""--- Other"" category.
6.  *National Tariff Line*: The product is ""Men's Shoes."" The statistical suffix "".32"" specifically designates ""Male footwear exceeding size 1, second series"" under 6402.99.90. This provides the exact 10-digit code required for Australia.
7.  *Footwear-Specific Considerations*: The product is regular footwear, not athletic/sports, and is low-cut, aligning with the ""not covering the ankle"" classification. The materials (rubber sole, plastic upper) are the primary drivers for classification under 6402.",2025-10-12 12:05:47

0,AUSTRALIA,Shoes Mid Cut,Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber,Missiongrip Rubber,Kids,Product for AUSTRALIA: Kids's Shoes Mid Cut Material: Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber. Construction: Missiongrip Rubber.,6404.11.9003,85,6404119003,6404.11.9003,100,Validated (with Reasoning),"1.  *GRI Application*: GRI 1 dictates that classification is determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes. Chapter 64 is the dedicated chapter for footwear. Heading 6404 specifically covers ""FOOTWEAR WITH OUTER SOLES OF RUBBER, PLASTICS, LEATHER OR COMPOSITION LEATHER AND UPPERS OF TEXTILE MATERIALS."" The product's outer sole of rubber and upper of textile materials perfectly align with this heading.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: The historical data provides a strong precedent, classifying a very similar product (0.86 similarity) with identical gender (Kids), sole material (Rubber), upper material (Textile), and construction (Missiongrip Rubber) under HS Code 6404119003. This significantly influences the current classification towards this option.
3.  *Chapter Determination*: Chapter 64 is chosen as it is the specific chapter for footwear.
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 6404 is selected because the product's outer sole is rubber and its upper is textile, directly matching the primary criteria of this heading.
5.  *Subheading Determination*: Subheading 6404.1 covers ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics,"" which is applicable as the product has a rubber sole. Further, subheading 6404.11 specifically covers ""Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like."" The ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction strongly implies a performance-oriented sole, characteristic of sports or outdoor athletic footwear. ""Kids's Shoes"" can certainly fall under the category of sports footwear.
6.  *National Tariff Line*: Within 6404.11.90 (""--- Other"" sports footwear), the statistical suffix ""03"" for ""Other"" is chosen. This is appropriate for ""Kids's Shoes"" as they are not specifically classified as ""Female footwear exceeding size 1, second series"" (01) or ""Male footwear exceeding size 1, second series"" (02).
7.  *Footwear-Specific Considerations*: The ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction is a crucial factor in identifying this as ""sports footwear"" due to its implied performance and grip characteristics. The ""Mid Cut"" style is also commonly found in athletic or hiking shoes.",2025-10-15 16:15:06
1,JAPAN,Shoes Mid Cut,Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber,Missiongrip Rubber,Kids,Product for JAPAN: Kids's Shoes Mid Cut Material: Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber. Construction: Missiongrip Rubber.,6404.11.000,80,640411000,6404.11.000,100,Validated (with Reasoning),"1.  *GRI Application*: GRI 1 is applied, as the product's description directly matches the terms of Heading 64.04 and Subheading 6404.11. GRI 6 is used to determine the national tariff line, ensuring the most specific classification within the hierarchy.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: Historical data for a very similar product (Kids' Shoes, Textile upper, Rubber sole, Missiongrip Rubber construction) was previously classified under 6404.11.000. This strong precedent, with identical key characteristics (materials, construction, and gender), heavily influences the classification of the current product as sports footwear. The ""Mid Cut"" aspect does not preclude it from this subheading.
3.  *Chapter Determination*: Chapter 64 is chosen as it specifically covers ""Footwear, gaiters and the like; parts of such articles,"" which directly applies to the product.
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 64.04 is selected because it explicitly covers ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials."" The product's outer sole of rubber and uppers of textile materials perfectly align with this heading.
5.  *Subheading Determination*: Subheading 6404.11 is chosen because the product's ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction, which implies specialized grip and durability, combined with its designation as ""Kids' Shoes"" (often implying active use), strongly suggests an intended use as ""Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like."" The ""Mid Cut"" design is consistent with various types of athletic footwear.
6.  *National Tariff Line*: The national tariff line ""000"" is the only available and most specific option provided under 6404.11, completing the 9-digit HS code for Japan.
7.  *Footwear-Specific Considerations*: The ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction is a critical indicator of athletic or performance-oriented footwear, directly supporting the ""Sports footwear"" classification. The ""Kids'"" aspect further reinforces the likelihood of active or sports-related use.",2025-10-15 16:15:06
2,SWITZERLAND,Shoes Mid Cut,Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber,Missiongrip Rubber,Kids,Product for SWITZERLAND: Kids's Shoes Mid Cut Material: Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber. Construction: Missiongrip Rubber.,6404.1100-000,80,64041100-000,6404.1100-000,100,Validated (with Reasoning),"1.  *GRI Application*: GRI 1 directs classification according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes. GRI 6 applies the same principle to subheadings.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: No similar historical footwear data was found, so classification relies solely on the provided product description and official documentation.
3.  *Chapter Determination*: Chapter 64 is chosen as it specifically covers ""Footwear, gaiters and the like; parts of such articles."" The product is clearly footwear.
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 6404 is selected because it covers ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials."" The product explicitly states ""Sole: Rubber"" and ""Upper: Textile,"" perfectly matching this heading.
5.  *Subheading Determination*: Within Heading 6404, subheading 6404.1 covers ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics."" Further, subheading 6404.11 specifically covers ""Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like."" The ""Mid Cut"" design often provides ankle support, common in athletic footwear (e.g., basketball shoes, hiking shoes). The ""Missiongrip Rubber"" construction implies a specialized sole designed for enhanced grip and performance, which is a characteristic feature of sports or outdoor activity footwear. These elements strongly indicate an athletic or sports-oriented design for children.
6.  *National Tariff Line*: Assuming 6404.11.00 is the most granular 8-digit tariff item for ""Sports footwear"" with rubber soles and textile uppers in the official Swiss documentation. For Switzerland, the code must be 11 digits, so ""-000"" is appended to form 6404.1100-000.
7.  *Footwear-Specific Considerations*: The combination of ""Mid Cut"" and ""Missiongrip Rubber"" points to athletic/sports footwear. The ""Kids's"" designation indicates children's footwear, which falls under the general sports footwear category if no more specific children's sub-subheading is provided in the official documentation.",2025-10-15 16:15:06
3,UNITED STATES,Shoes Low cut,Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber,Rubber,Men,Product for UNITED STATES: Men's Shoes Low cut Material: Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber. Construction: Rubber.,6404.11.9020,90,6404119020,6404.11.9020,100,Validated (with Reasoning),"1.  *GRI Application*: GRI 1 is applied to determine the appropriate heading and subheading based on the materials of the outer sole and upper. GRI 6 is applied for the determination of the statistical suffix, ensuring the most specific classification within the chosen subheading.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: The historical data for a product with identical characteristics (Gender: Men, Desc1: Shoes, Desc2: Low cut, Material: Upper: Textile / Sole: Rubber, Construction: Rubber) points to HS Code 6404119050. This strongly indicates that the base 8-digit code 6404.11.90 is the correct classification. The only adjustment needed is the statistical suffix to match the specified gender of the current product.
3.  *Chapter Determination*: The product is footwear, therefore, it falls under Chapter 64, ""FOOTWEAR, GAITERS AND THE LIKE; PARTS OF SUCH ARTICLES.""
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 6404 is selected: ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials."" This heading is appropriate because the product has an outer sole of rubber and an upper of textile materials, directly matching the heading's description.
5.  *Subheading Determination*: Subheading 6404.11 is chosen: ""Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like."" While the product description does not explicitly state ""sports footwear,"" Additional U.S. Note 2 clarifies that ""tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like"" covers ""athletic footwear other than sports footwear (as defined in subheading note 1 above), whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes."" Low-cut shoes with textile uppers and rubber soles are commonly considered athletic footwear, and the historical data supports this interpretation.
6.  *National Tariff Line*: Within subheading 6404.11, the product does not have uppers of which over 50 percent is leather (excluding 6404.11.20). Without specific value information, and guided by the historical data, the ""Valued over $12/pair"" category (6404.11.90) is chosen as a general classification for non-cheap athletic footwear. The product is ""Men's,"" so the statistical suffix ""20"" (""For men: Other"") is selected, as the shoes are not ski-boots, cross-country ski footwear, or snowboard boots.
7.  *Footwear-Specific Considerations*: The combination of a rubber outer sole and textile upper is characteristic of athletic or casual athletic footwear. The ""low cut"" description further supports this, as does the ""Construction: Rubber"" detail, which reinforces the primary sole material.",2025-10-15 16:15:06
4,AUSTRALIA,Shoes Low cut,Upper: Plastic / Sole: Rubber,Rubber,Men,Product for AUSTRALIA: Men's Shoes Low cut Material: Upper: Plastic / Sole: Rubber. Construction: Rubber.,6402.99.90.32,95,6402999032,6402.99.90.32,100,Validated (with Reasoning),"1.  *GRI Application*: GRI 1 directs classification based on heading terms and Chapter Notes. Chapter 64 is appropriate for footwear. GRI 6 is applied for subheading determination, comparing subheadings at the same level.
2.  *Historical Data Consideration*: The historical classification of a similar product (Gender: Men, Desc1: Shoes, Desc2: Low cut, Material: Upper: Plastic / Sole: Rubber, Construction: Missiongrip Rubber) to HS Code 6402999032 strongly supports this option. This historical precedent aligns perfectly with the current product's characteristics.
3.  *Chapter Determination*: Chapter 64 is selected as it specifically covers ""FOOTWEAR"".
4.  *Heading Selection*: Heading 6402 is chosen because the product has ""OUTER SOLES AND UPPERS OF RUBBER OR PLASTICS"". The product's outer sole is Rubber and its upper is Plastic, fitting this description precisely. Heading 6401 was considered but rejected due to the lack of explicit ""waterproof"" designation and, more critically, the absence of a 10-digit code in the provided documentation for Australia.
5.  *Subheading Determination*:
    *   **6402.9 - Other footwear:** The product is not described as ""sports footwear"" (6402.1) nor does it have ""upper straps or thongs assembled to the sole by means of plugs"" (6402.20.00). Therefore, it falls under ""Other footwear.""
    *   **6402.99 -- Other:** The product is described as ""Low cut,"" which means it does not cover the ankle. This excludes 6402.91 (""-- Covering the ankle"") and places it under 6402.99 (""-- Other,"" meaning not covering the ankle).
    *   **6402.99.90 --- Other:** Within 6402.99, the product is not ""of a kind used solely or principally in conjunction with diving dress or wetsuits"" (6402.99.10), leading to the general ""--- Other"" category.
6.  *National Tariff Line*: The product is ""Men's Shoes."" The statistical suffix "".32"" specifically designates ""Male footwear exceeding size 1, second series"" under 6402.99.90. This provides the exact 10-digit code required for Australia.
7.  *Footwear-Specific Considerations*: The product is regular footwear, not athletic/sports, and is low-cut, aligning with the ""not covering the ankle"" classification. The materials (rubber sole, plastic upper) are the primary drivers for classification under 6402.",2025-10-15 16:15:06
