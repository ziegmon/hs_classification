    * Chapter 61: Articles of Apparel and Clothing Accessories, Knitted or Crocheted. The product is a knitted t-shirt, so Chapter 61 is appropriate.
4. *Heading & Subheading Determination*:
    * Heading 6109: T-shirts, singlets and other vests, knitted or crocheted. This fits the description of the product.
    * Subheading 6109.90: Of other textile materials. Since the t-shirt is made of 85% polyester and 15% Elastane, it is not made of cotton, so it falls under ""other textile materials"".
5. *National Tariff Line Determination*:
    * The 8-digit code is `6109.90.00`. The statistical suffix for Switzerland is `-000`.
6. *Exclusions & Verifications*:
    * The product is not a shirt (6105) or blouse (6106). It does not have features that would exclude it from 6109 based on Anmerkung 5.
7. ***Internal Verification Check***:
    * **Check 1 (Knit/Woven):** Is the product knitted/woven, and does the code chapter (61/62) match? Yes, the product is knitted, and the code is in Chapter 61.

    * **Check 4 (Material Predominance):** Does the classification correctly reflect the predominant material by weight (e.g., classifying as 'Of cotton' if cotton > 50%)? Yes, the predominant material is polyester, and the code reflects ""other textile materials"" since it is not cotton.",2025-10-23 21:29:36

2. *Historical Data Consideration*:
    * The provided example classification for Canada, ""Men's T-shirt, knitted, made of 100% polyester"" with HS code `6109.90.00.10`, is highly relevant. This suggests that heading 6109 and subheading 6109.90 are appropriate for knitted t-shirts made of polyester.
